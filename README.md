# ‚ö´ Recursion in Tech Interviews 2024: 11 Must-Know Questions & Answers

**Recursion** is a technique in which a function calls itself, breaking problems down into simpler instances of the same problem. It's fundamental in solving problems like tree traversals and combinatorial tasks. In coding interviews, recursion questions evaluate a candidate's ability to think in terms of **self-referential logic** and their grasp on **base cases** and **recursive steps**.

Check out our carefully selected list of **basic** and **advanced** Recursion questions and answers to be well-prepared for your tech interviews in 2024.

## üîπ 1. What are some _Common Examples_ of _Recursion_ in computer science?

### Answer

Let's look into some examples and see how they utilize the core concepts of **recursion**.

### 1. Binary Tree Traversal

In binary tree traversal, nodes are visited **recursively**, exploring the left and right subtrees in various orders.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def in_order_traversal(node):
    if node is not None:
        in_order_traversal(node.left)
        print(node.value)
        in_order_traversal(node.right)
```

### 2. Palindrome Check

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. To determine a palindrome, the outer characters of a word are compared. If they match, the inner substring is checked recursively.

```python
def is_palindrome(word):
    if len(word) <= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] == word[-1]:
        return is_palindrome(word[1:-1])
    return False
```

### 3. Factorial Calculation

The factorial of a number is calculated using a **base** and **recursive** case. $0! = 1$ and $n! = n \times (n-1)!$.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

### 4. Folder Hierarchy

A folder hierarchy in a file system can be traversed recursively, exploring the contents of each directory.

```python
import os

def folder_contents(path):
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        item_path = os.path.join(path, item)
        if os.path.isfile(item_path):
            print(f"Found a file: {item_path}")
        elif os.path.isdir(item_path):
            print(f"Entering folder: {item_path}")
            folder_contents(item_path)
```

### 5. Towers of Hanoi

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes, which can be moved from one peg to another following a set of rules. It's often used as an example in computer science textbooks to illustrate how recursion can be used to solve problems.

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
        return
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
```

### 6. Merge Sort

This sorting algorithm follows the **divide-and-conquer** paradigm, using recursion to split and then merge lists.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)
    return merge(left_half, right_half)
```

### 7. Catalan Numbers

The **Catalan numbers** form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursive structures. The recursive formula for the $n$-th Catalan number is 

$$
C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i \cdot C_{n-1-i}
$$

where the base case is $C_0 = 1$.

## üîπ 2. What is the difference between _Backtracking_ and _Recursion_?

### Answer

**Backtracking** often employs **recursion** to explore the vast space of possible solutions. However, not all recursive algorithms involve backtracking.

Think of **recursion** as the mechanism that enables a function to call itself, and **backtracking** as a strategy where you make a choice and explore the possibilities.

### Key Concepts

- **Recursion**: Utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking the main problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. Recursive calls work towards solving these subproblems, relying on defined base cases for termination.

- **Backtracking**: Operates as an advanced form of recursion by building solutions incrementally. When a partial solution is deemed unsuitable, it "backtracks" to modify previous choices, ensuring an efficient traversal through the solution space.

### Common Applications

#### Recursion

- **Tree Traversals**: Visiting all nodes in a tree, like in binary search trees.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Such as merge sort or quick sort.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems like the coin change problem by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

#### Backtracking

- **Puzzle Solvers**: Solving games like Sudoku or crossword puzzles.
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Generating all permutations or combinations of a set.
- **Decision-making Problems**: Such as the knapsack problem, where decisions are made on whether to include items.

## üîπ 3. How _Dynamic Programming_ is different from _Recursion_ and _Memoization_?

### Answer

**Dynamic Programming** (DP), **Recursion**, and **Memoization** are techniques for solving problems that can be divided into smaller, overlapping sub-problems. While they share this commonality, they each offer unique advantages and limitations. 

### Key Distinctions

1. **Efficiency**: DP typically leads to polynomial-time algorithms, whereas Recursion and Memoization can result in higher time complexities.
  
2. **Problem-Solving Direction**: DP builds solutions from the ground up, focusing on smaller sub-problems first. In contrast, Recursion and Memoization usually adopt a top-down approach.

3. **Implementation Style**: DP and Memoization can be implemented either iteratively or recursively, while Recursion is, by definition, a recursive technique.

4. **Sub-Problem Coverage**: DP aims to solve all relevant sub-problems, whereas Memoization and Recursion solve sub-problems on an as-needed basis.

5. **Memory Use**: DP often requires less memory than Memoization, as it doesn't store every state reached through recursive calls.

## üîπ 4. Explain the _Depth-First Search_ algorithm.

### Answer

**Depth-First Search** (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that's simpler and **often faster** than its breadth-first counterpart (BFS). While it **might not explore all vertices**, DFS is still fundamental to numerous graph algorithms.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Select a starting vertex, mark it as visited, and put it on a stack.
2. **Loop**: Until the stack is empty, do the following:
   - Remove the top vertex from the stack.
   - Explore its unvisited neighbors and add them to the stack.
3. **Finish**: When the stack is empty, the algorithm ends, and all reachable vertices are visited.

### Visual Representation

### Code Example: Depth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)
    
    return visited

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'G': {'A'},
    'E': {'B', 'G'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'F'}
}

print(dfs(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}
```
